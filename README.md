## 💡 Motivation (개발 동기)

When planning university timetables, I always prioritize the courses I actually want to take rather than which professor is teaching them. However, manually mapping and combining different course divisions while ensuring zero time overlaps was extremely tedious and frustrating to do every single semester. 

This tool was built to solve that exact problem: to instantly automate the combinatorics of schedule generation, allowing students to select their desired curriculum and get all valid, collision-free timetable options in milliseconds.

## ⚡ Key Features

* **📋 Smart Raw Text Parser:** Automatically extracts course codes, names, credits, classroom locations, instructor names, and weekly time slots directly from university portal transcripts (KNU Yoram / Everytime) using robust regex heuristics.
* **🔀 Backtracking Constraint Solver:** Computes every valid, non-overlapping weekly schedule combination in $\mathcal{O}(N)$ optimized search space.
* **🔍 Fine-Grained Advanced Filters:**
  * **Day-Off (공강) Selector:** Lock specific days (e.g., Friday-off) to exclude schedules.
  * **Time Range Restrictor:** Exclude morning classes (e.g., 9:00 AM) or late-evening sessions.
  * **Continuous Lecture (연강) Optimizer:** Prioritize schedules with adjacent classes over scattered intervals.
  * **Instructor Blacklist/Whitelist:** Instantly filter schedules based on specific lecturers.
* **🔒 Privacy-by-Design:** No server-side backend. All data parsing, combination generation, and exports (JSON/Image) occur strictly inside the browser sandbox.
* **🌗 Adaptive Glassmorphic Theme:** Automatically switches between Light and Dark modes based on local time and system preferences.

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture

### 1. Heuristic Parsing Engine (`parser.ts`)
The text parser utilizes complex regex mapping to process raw copy-pasted rows from academic systems. It handles non-standardized formats such as:
```text
수09:00~11:40(새304), 금11:50~13:05(새301)
```
The parser converts this string into structured weekly slots:
$$\text{Day Index} \in [0..4] \quad (\text{Mon..Fri})$$
$$\text{Start / End Time} \in [0..1440] \quad (\text{Minutes from midnight})$$

### 2. Constraint Satisfaction Scheduler (`scheduler.ts`)
The timetable combinations generator treats schedule generation as a **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)**. It runs a depth-first search (DFS) with backtracking:
* **Pruning:** If a selected course section overlaps with already scheduled blocks, the sub-tree is pruned immediately.
* **Sorting:** Timetables are ranked dynamically using preference scoring (e.g., number of continuous lectures, total school days, credit load).
